## Goal

# Turn “power” into a number

::: notes
Now we connect power to the ANOVA F test.
:::

## Reminder: the ANOVA test

# $F = \dfrac{\text{MSTrt}}{\text{MSE}}$

::: notes
Same test as before — we’re just asking a new question.
:::

## Distribution of $F$

::: columns
::: column
### If $H_0$ is true

$F \sim F(\text{df}_1,\text{df}_2)$  
(Central $F$)
:::

::: column
### If a specific $H_A$ is true

$F \sim F(\text{df}_1,\text{df}_2,\lambda)$  
(Noncentral $F$)
:::
:::

::: notes
Under an alternative, the F statistic is noncentral.
:::

## Degrees of freedom (CRD)

If we have $t$ treatments and $r$ reps each:

- $\text{df}_1 = t - 1$
- $\text{df}_2 = t(r - 1)$

::: notes
These are straight from the ANOVA table.
:::

## The noncentrality parameter

# $\displaystyle \lambda = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{t}(\mu_i-\bar{\mu})^2}{\sigma^2 / r}$

::: notes
Explain what increases lambda:
larger separation, smaller noise, larger sample size.
:::

## Sanity check

# If all means are equal, then $\lambda = 0$

::: notes
So the noncentral F reduces to the central F.
:::

## Power as an area

![](/mnt/data/mod3_fplot.png){width=90%}

::: notes
Power is the probability that F exceeds the critical value under the noncentral distribution.
:::

## Runner example (numbers)

Assume:

- $t = 4$, $r = 3$
- $\alpha = 0.05$
- $\sigma^2 \approx 17.5$
- $\delta = 10$

::: notes
This anchors the example without derivations.
:::

## Mean patterns matter

Even with the same max difference $\delta$…

![](/mnt/data/mod3_configurations.png){width=90%}

::: notes
Different configurations lead to different values of lambda and power.
:::

## Power depends on the configuration

| Mean pattern | Power (approx.) |
|---|---:|
| Maximum power | 0.78 |
| Minimum power | 0.47 |
| Equally spaced | 0.51 |
| All but one equal | 0.65 |

::: notes
Worst-case power is often used for conservative planning.
:::

## Using JMP

# DOE → Sample Size Explorers → Power → Power for ANOVA

::: notes
JMP automates the noncentral F calculation.
:::

## Two common planning questions

::: columns
::: column
### How many reps do we need?

Fix $\alpha$, $\sigma^2$, $\delta$  
Solve for **$r$**
:::

::: column
### What difference can we detect?

Fix $\alpha$, $\sigma^2$, $r$  
Solve for **$\delta$**
:::
:::

::: notes
These are exactly the two modes you’ll see in JMP.
:::

## Power in R (optional)

- `pwr2::pwr.1way()`
- `pwr2::ss.1way()`

::: notes
Same inputs, same logic — different interface.
:::

## Wrap-up

# Power is a design choice

It depends on:

- the effect you care about
- the noise you expect
- how much data you collect
- how cautious you want to be

::: notes
Next: in-class activity + learning quiz.
