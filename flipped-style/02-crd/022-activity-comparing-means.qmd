Scientists are interested in whether the energy costs of reproduction affect longevity in male fruit flies.

In this experiment:

-   125 male fruit flies were randomly assigned to 5 treatment groups (25 flies per group).

-   Males were housed individually.

-   The treatments differed by the number and type of female companions provided per day:

| Companion    | Description           |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| 1P (i = 1)   | One pregnant female   |
| 8P (i = 2)   | Eight pregnant female |
| 1V (i = 3)   | One virgin females    |
| 8V (i = 4)   | Eight virgin female   |
| None (i = 5) | No female companions  |

The response variable was longevity (days alive) for each male fruit fly.

The data are provided in `02_fruitfly_data.csv` on Canvas.

`r fontawesome::fa("warning")` If using R, make sure to set your "sum to zero" constraint *before* fitting your model with `lm()`.

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))

# read in data
fruitfly_data <- read_csv("data/02_fruitfly_data.csv") |>
  mutate(Companions = factor(Companions))

# check levels
levels(fruitfly_data$Companions)
```

## a. Skeleton ANOVA

Fill out the skeleton ANOVA according to the study.

| Source of Variation (SV) | DF (total = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|                          |                                     |
|                          |                                     |
|                          |                                     |
|                          |                                     |
|                          |                                     |
|                          |                                     |

## b. Overall ANOVA F-test

Run an ANOVA in JMP/R to assess whether any differences in mean longevity exist among the treatments. *Get in the habit of checking your model assumptions – residual vs fitted & qq-plots*.

-   Complete the hypotheses using notation:

    -   $H_0$:

    -   $H_A:$

-   Write your conclusion in context including all evidence (F = ; df = ; p = ).

## c. Least Squares Means

Use JMP/R to obtain the estimated mean longevity and standard error for each treatment. Create a plot of the least square means (look at it!).

| Companion | LSMean       | Standard Error |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 1P        | $\hat\mu_1=$ |                |
| 8P        | $\hat\mu_2=$ |                |
| 1V        | $\hat\mu_3=$ |                |
| 8V        | $\hat\mu_4=$ |                |
| None      | $\hat\mu_5=$ |                |

## d. Interpret Estimated Means

Using the estimated parameters / coefficients (e.g., $\hat \mu$, $\hat \tau_1$, $\hat{\sigma}^2$), show by hand how $\hat \mu_1$ and $SE(\hat \mu_1)$ is obtained. Interpret these values in context of the problem.

-   $\hat \mu_1=$

    \vspace{0.6in}

-   $SE(\hat\mu_1)=$

    \vspace{0.6in}

## e. Planned Contrast 1: Any Females vs No Females

Scientists are interested in whether exposure to any females affects longevity.

-   Write the Contrast:

-   Using JMP/R, carry out the test and provide the following in context of the problem:

    -   Interpret the estimated mean:

        \vspace{0.6in}

    -   Interpret the confidence interval:

        \vspace{0.6in}

    -   Provide a conclusion for the test (include all evidence – t = , df = , p = ):

        \vspace{0.6in}

## f. Pairwise Comparisons

Scientists also want to know which specific treatments differ from each other.

Perform all pairwise comparisons using *no* adjustment (i.e., Fishers LSD) and *Tukey's* adjustment. Provide the p-value for each pairwise comparison in the table below.

+----------------+----------+--------------------+-------------------+
| Comparison\    | Estimate | Unadjusted p-value | Adjusted p-value\ |
| (e.g. 1P - 1V) |          |                    | Tukey)            |

## h. (Optional) Extra practice with contrasts

Identify the contrast coefficients for the following comparisons. Can you test these in R/JMP? How are they tested by hand?

|-------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Any Companion vs None                     |     |     |     |     |      |
| Exposure to one female vs eight females   |     |     |     |     |      |
| One virgin female vs eight virgin females |     |     |     |     |      |
