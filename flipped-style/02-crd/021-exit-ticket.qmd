**In 2-3 sentences, explain what MSE (experimental error) measures (conceptually, not notationally) and how it affects detecting differences in treatment means.**

You may chose to use an example from class (e.g., shoe types, traffic signals, fruit flies) to discuss this.

*Entry/Exit tickets will be graded for intellectual engagement only, not correctness.*
