*Entry/Exit tickets will be graded for intellectual engagement only, not correctness.*

Recall for your final project, you’ll design an experiment (no data collection) and convince an audience of stakeholders that your research question (RQ), experimental design, and proposed analysis are sound. 

The key twist: your experimental units (and similarly, your blocking or subsampling) cannot be people or animals

Before you leave, write down something you’ve wondered about recently that could be studied experimentally.

+ What could you randomize?
+ What might be the experimental unit?
+ Is there any natural grouping or hierarchy of units?
+ What other things might impact the variability?
